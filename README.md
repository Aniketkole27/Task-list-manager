# Task-list-manager
A simple task list manager that allows users to add, edit, and update tasks

Implemented a task management system with the following features:
1. **Text Input Bar**: Allows the user to type a task to be added to the task list.
2. **Add Task Button**: Adds the task from the input field to the list. Tasks can also be added by pressing the 'Enter' key.
3. **Edit Task Button**: Puts the task list into edit mode, where clicking on any task triggers a prompt to modify the task text.
4. **Dynamic Styling**: 
   - The "Edit" button changes its background color to light green when in edit mode, providing visual feedback to the user.
5. **Task Click Behavior**: In edit mode, clicking on a task opens a prompt to edit the task. The task text is updated only if the user provides valid input.
6. **Task List Interaction**: Tasks are appended to the list dynamically and are marked as editable after they are added.
